# cmake-format

[cmake-format][1] can format your listfiles nicely so that they don't look like
crap.

## Features

The `cmake-format` extension for vscode provides a document format
command for listfiles. The extension is quite limmited in scope to just this
one feature. I may grow it in the future to provide more language support
features for cmake.

## Requirements

In order for this extension to work you must have `cmake-format` installed.
The recommended way to do that is through `pip`.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Currently there are no known issues with the vscode extension. You can find
known issues with `cmake-format` on [github][3]


## Release Notes

### 0.4.1

Initial release. Note that the vscode extension release version matches the
cmake-format release version on [pypi][2].
